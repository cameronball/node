# A 3D/2D Hybrid Game made with Unity
A quick game made in a couple hours just trying to get used with Unity for mobile/pc cross development.
## Installation
Check the releases tab for precompiled APKS. Currently awaiting approval for the google play store. Unlikely to come to the Apple App Store as I'm not currently in a position to pay the fee for a single app I made just for learning on unity sorry :)
